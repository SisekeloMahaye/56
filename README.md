# Group 57 Miro Mouse Project

## Overview
This repository contains the documentation for Group 57's Miro Mouse project. The Miro Mouse is a small robotic platform designed for navigating mazes autonomously.

## Team Members
- MHYSIS001: Responsible for the power subsystem.
- ZKHMUS002: Responsible for the sensing subsystem.

## Subsystems
### Power Subsystem (MHYSIS001)
The power subsystem manages the energy requirements of the Miro Mouse. It includes components such as batteries.

### Sensing Subsystem (ZKHMUS002)
The sensing subsystem is responsible for gathering information about the environment. It includes sensors such as infrared sensors, and any other sensors needed for maze navigation.
